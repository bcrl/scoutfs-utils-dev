 * Fill the path buffer with the next path to the target inode.  An

 *
 * @ino: The target ino that we're finding paths to.  Constant across
 * all the calls that make up an iteration over all the inode's paths.
 *
 * @cursor_ptr: A pointer to the buffer that will hold the iteration
 * cursor.  It must be initialized to 0 before iterating.  Each call
 * modifies it to skip past the result of that call.
 *
 * @cusur_bytes: The length of the cursor buffer.  Must be
 * SCOUTFS_IOC_INO_PATH_CURSOR_BYTES.
 *
 * @path_ptr: The buffer to store each found path.
 *
 * @path_bytes: The size of the buffer that will the found path
 * including null termination.  (PATH_MAX is a solid choice.)
 *
 * This only walks back through full hard links.  None of the returned
 * paths will reflect symlinks to components in the path.
 *
 * This doesn't ensure that the caller has permissions to traverse the
 * returned paths to the inode.  It requires CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH which
 * bypasses permissions checking.
 *
 * ENAMETOOLONG is returned when the next path found from the cursor
 * doesn't fit in the path buffer.
 *
 * This call is not serialized with any modification (create, rename,
 * unlink) of the path components.  It will return all the paths that
 * were stable both before and after the call.  It may or may not return
 * paths which are created or unlinked during the call.
 *
 * The number of bytes in the path, including the null terminator, are
 * returned when a path is found.  0 is returned when there are no more
 * paths to the link to the inode from the cursor.
